# SVGit4Me Deployment Guide

## The Challenge

SVGit4Me uses high-quality vectorization tools (`vtracer` and `potrace`) that require system binaries. These tools provide superior SVG conversion quality compared to WebAssembly alternatives.

**Problem**: Vercel's serverless functions don't have access to system binaries like `vtracer` and `potrace`.

## Recommended Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker-Based Deployment (Recommended)

Since we already have a working Docker container, deploy to platforms that support Docker:

#### Railway (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Easy deployment, supports Docker, good free tier
- **Deployment**: Connect GitHub repo, Railway will auto-detect Dockerfile
- **URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app`

#### Render
- **Pros**: Free tier, Docker support, easy setup
- **Deployment**: Connect repo, select Docker environment
- **URL**: `https://your-app.onrender.com`

#### DigitalOcean App Platform
- **Pros**: Production-ready, Docker-native, good performance
- **Deployment**: Connect repo, select Docker source
- **URL**: `https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app`

#### AWS ECS/Fargate
- **Pros**: Enterprise-grade, highly scalable
- **Deployment**: Push Docker image to ECR, deploy to ECS
- **URL**: Custom domain

### Option 2: Vercel with External API

Keep the frontend on Vercel but move the vectorization to a separate service:

1. **Deploy the Docker container** to Railway/Render for the API
2. **Update the frontend** to call the external API
3. **Keep the UI on Vercel** for fast static hosting

### Option 3: Vercel with Custom Buildpack (Advanced)

Use Vercel's custom buildpacks to install the required binaries:

```bash
# Create .vercelignore
node_modules
.next

# Create vercel-build.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Install system dependencies
apt-get update
apt-get install -y vtracer potrace imagemagick
npm run build
```

## Quick Deployment to Railway

1. **Push your code** to GitHub (already done)
2. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app
3. **Connect your GitHub repo**
4. **Railway will auto-detect** the Dockerfile
5. **Deploy** - Railway will build and run the container
6. **Get your URL** - `https://your-app.railway.app`

## Environment Variables

For production deployment, you may want to set:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Testing the Deployment

After deployment, test the vectorization:

1. **Upload an image** to your deployed app
2. **Try different presets** (Color, Black & White)
3. **Check the SVG output** quality
4. **Verify download** functionality

## Why This Approach?

- **Maintains Quality**: Uses the same high-quality tools as local development
- **Consistent Results**: Same output as your local testing
- **Scalable**: Docker containers can be easily scaled
- **Reliable**: No dependency on WebAssembly limitations

## Current Status

✅ **Docker container** is working locally  
✅ **All dependencies** are properly configured  
✅ **Health checks** are implemented  
✅ **Ready for deployment** to Docker-supporting platforms  

## Next Steps

1. **Choose a deployment platform** (Railway recommended)
2. **Deploy the Docker container**
3. **Test the vectorization** functionality
4. **Configure custom domain** if needed
5. **Set up monitoring** and logging

The Docker container we built and tested locally is production-ready and will provide the same high-quality vectorization results as your local environment.
