# Progress

## What Works
- **Complete SVG conversion pipeline**: Users can upload raster images and convert to high-quality SVGs
- **Privacy-first processing**: All conversion happens locally in Docker containers with zero data upload
- **Image preprocessing**: ImageMagick trim and repage operations ensure optimal input for vectorization
- **Dual vectorization engines**: VTracer for color images, Potrace for black & white with proper preprocessing
- **Dimension accuracy**: SVG output exactly matches original image dimensions
- **Quality assurance**: Black border artifacts eliminated through targeted post-processing
- **Professional UI**: Step-by-step interface with Radix UI components and accessibility features
- **Pan/zoom functionality**: Consistent controls for both raster and SVG previews with reset capabilities
- **Download and copy features**: Always-visible controls with clear disabled states and helpful tooltips
- **Docker containerization**: Production-ready container with multi-stage builds and health monitoring
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Up-to-date Memory Bank and README with deployment guides
- **Debug logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and quality verification

## What's Left to Build
- Further UI/UX polish for compactness and clarity.
- More robust error messages and edge case handling.
- Potential for additional presets or backend engines.
- **Cloud deployment**: Deploy Docker container to production platform (Vercel, Railway, Render, etc.).
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Set up automated builds and deployments.
- **Environment configuration**: Configure production environment variables.

## Current Status
- **Production ready**: Core functionality is stable, tested, and deployment-ready
- **Privacy-first architecture**: Local Docker processing ensures user data never leaves their machine
- **Quality vectorization**: Black border issues resolved, dimension accuracy achieved
- **Professional UI/UX**: Step-by-step interface with accessibility features and smooth interactions
- **Comprehensive preprocessing**: Image optimization pipeline ensures optimal vectorization results
- **Robust error handling**: Detailed logging and graceful fallbacks for edge cases
- **Complete documentation**: Memory Bank and README reflect current implementation and deployment strategies

## Known Issues
- Some edge cases may not be fully handled (e.g., unusual image formats, backend failures).
- Error messages could be more descriptive in some scenarios.
