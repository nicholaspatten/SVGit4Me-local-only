# Progress

## What Works
- Users can upload raster images and convert them to SVGs using VTracer or Potrace.
- Preset system is functional, with custom Radix UI Select dropdown (black/white, fully styled) and auto-backend selection.
- Step-by-step UI flow is implemented, visually clear, compact, and borderless for steps 1-4.
- SVG output is previewed and downloadable.
- Tooltips provide guidance for Step 4 Download and Copy buttons (with TooltipProvider at root).
- Error handling for common backend issues (e.g., color precision).

## What's Left to Build
- Further UI/UX polish for compactness and clarity.
- More robust error messages and edge case handling.
- Potential for additional presets or backend engines.
- Automated tests and deployment scripts.

## Current Status
- Core functionality is stable and usable.
- UI and backend are in sync for settings and presets.
- Documentation (Memory Bank) is being established and maintained.
- Accessibility and user guidance have improved with tooltips and compact design.

## Known Issues
- Some edge cases may not be fully handled (e.g., unusual image formats, backend failures).
- Error messages could be more descriptive in some scenarios.
