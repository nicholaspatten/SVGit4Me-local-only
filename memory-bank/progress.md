# Progress

## What Works
- Users can upload raster images and convert them to SVGs using VTracer or Potrace.
- Preset system is functional, with custom Radix UI Select dropdown (black/white, fully styled) and auto-backend selection.
- Step-by-step UI flow is implemented, visually clear, compact, and borderless for steps 1-4.
- SVG output is previewed and downloadable.
- Tooltips provide guidance for Step 4 Download and Copy buttons (with TooltipProvider at root).
- Error handling for common backend issues (e.g., color precision).
- Pan/zoom for both raster and SVG previews, with clamping and reset controls.
- Tooltip logic uses timers to prevent flashing and improve usability.
- Download and copy controls for SVG output are always visible, with clear disabled states and tooltips.
- Comprehensive README created, including logo, project description, features, setup, and usage instructions.
- Documentation (Memory Bank) is up to date and maintained.
- **Docker containerization is complete and tested**: Production-ready container with multi-stage build, health checks, and deployment scripts.
- **Local Docker testing successful**: Container builds in ~34s, starts in ~42ms, and serves application correctly.
- **Health endpoint implemented**: `/api/health` provides container monitoring capabilities.

## What's Left to Build
- Further UI/UX polish for compactness and clarity.
- More robust error messages and edge case handling.
- Potential for additional presets or backend engines.
- **Cloud deployment**: Deploy Docker container to production platform (Vercel, Railway, Render, etc.).
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Set up automated builds and deployments.
- **Environment configuration**: Configure production environment variables.

## Current Status
- Core functionality is stable and usable.
- UI and backend are in sync for settings and presets.
- Accessibility and user guidance have improved with tooltips, pan/zoom, and compact design.
- Documentation (Memory Bank) is current and reflects the latest implementation.
- **Docker containerization is production-ready**: Multi-stage build, health checks, and deployment scripts are complete and tested.
- **Application is containerized and deployable**: Ready for cloud deployment to any Docker-supporting platform.

## Known Issues
- Some edge cases may not be fully handled (e.g., unusual image formats, backend failures).
- Error messages could be more descriptive in some scenarios.
