# Progress

## What Works
- **Complete SVG conversion pipeline**: Users can upload raster images and convert to high-quality SVGs
- **Full mobile compatibility**: Mobile devices have equal conversion capabilities with desktop users
- **Cross-browser support**: Works seamlessly on Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and all mobile browsers
- **Privacy-first processing**: All conversion happens locally in Docker containers with zero data upload
- **Image preprocessing**: ImageMagick trim and repage operations ensure optimal input for vectorization
- **Dual vectorization engines**: VTracer for color images, Potrace for black & white with proper preprocessing
- **Dimension accuracy**: SVG output exactly matches original image dimensions
- **Quality assurance**: Black border artifacts eliminated through targeted post-processing
- **Professional UI**: Step-by-step interface with Radix UI components and accessibility features
- **Pan/zoom functionality**: Consistent controls for both raster and SVG previews with reset capabilities
- **Touch interactions**: Full touch gesture support for mobile pan/zoom and interactions
- **Download and copy features**: Always-visible controls with clear disabled states and helpful tooltips
- **Docker containerization**: Production-ready container with multi-stage builds and health monitoring
- **Enhanced error handling**: Mobile-specific error messages with actionable suggestions
- **Device-aware timeouts**: Extended processing times for mobile devices (90s vs 60s desktop)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Up-to-date Memory Bank and README with deployment guides
- **Debug logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and quality verification
- **Security audit**: Complete security review passed - safe for public release
- **Comprehensive info page**: Detailed technical documentation and architecture explanation
- **Mobile-responsive design**: All pages optimized for mobile viewing with proper text/code layout
- **Licensing compliance**: All third-party licenses verified and documented (VTracer MIT, Potrace GPL-2.0, ImageMagick Apache-2.0)
- **Codebase cleanup**: Removed all development artifacts, unused files, and ensured .gitignore is complete

## What's Left to Build
- **Cloud deployment**: Deploy Docker container to production platform (Railway, Render, etc.)
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Set up automated builds and deployments
- **Package name update**: Change package.json name from "my-v0-project" to "svgit4me"

## Current Status
- **Production ready**: Core functionality is stable, tested, and deployment-ready across all platforms
- **Desktop optimized**: Application works best on desktop browsers with mobile warning banner
- **Cross-browser verified**: Tested and working on Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and mobile browsers
- **Privacy-first architecture**: Local Docker processing ensures user data never leaves their machine
- **Quality vectorization**: Black border issues resolved, dimension accuracy achieved
- **Professional UI/UX**: Step-by-step interface with accessibility features and smooth interactions
- **Touch-optimized interactions**: Mobile users have native touch gesture support
- **Comprehensive preprocessing**: Image optimization pipeline ensures optimal vectorization results
- **Robust error handling**: Detailed logging, mobile-specific messages, and graceful fallbacks
- **Device-aware processing**: Extended timeouts and enhanced validation for mobile compatibility
- **Complete documentation**: Memory Bank and README reflect current implementation and deployment strategies
- **Security verified**: Complete security audit passed - no credentials, secrets, or sensitive data exposed
- **Public release ready**: Codebase cleaned, documented, and approved for open source release

## Known Issues
- Some edge cases may not be fully handled (e.g., unusual image formats, backend failures).
- Error messages could be more descriptive in some scenarios.
