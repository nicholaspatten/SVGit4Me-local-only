# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Converting raster images to SVGs is a common need for designers, developers, and businesses who want scalable, editable graphics. Existing tools are often limited in quality, flexibility, or ease of use. This app aims to provide a robust, user-friendly solution that supports both color and black & white vectorization, with professional results.

## Problems It Solves
- Difficulty converting raster images to clean, usable SVGs.
- Lack of easy-to-use, modern web tools for SVG conversion.
- Need for different vectorization styles (photo, logo, lineart, etc.) in one place.
- Frustration with poor error handling and confusing interfaces in existing tools.

## How It Should Work
- Users upload an image, select a preset, and convert to SVG in a few clear steps.
- The app automatically chooses the best backend (VTracer or Potrace) for the selected preset.
- Users can preview and download the SVG result instantly.
- The UI is modern, compact, and guides users through the process with clear feedback.

## User Experience Goals
- Fast, intuitive, and frustration-free.
- Professional look and feel.
- Clear step-by-step flow with minimal clutter.
- Robust error handling and helpful messages.
