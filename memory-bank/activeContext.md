## Next Steps
- **Make repository public**: Codebase is security-verified and ready for open source release
- **Update package.json name**: Change from "my-v0-project" to "svgit4me" 
- **Deploy Docker container to Railway/Render** (recommended platforms for quality)
- **Set up CI/CD pipeline** for automated Docker builds and deployments
- **Configure environment variables** for production deployment
- **Test vectorization quality** on deployed platform to ensure consistency
- **Community engagement**: Prepare for open source community contributions and issues

## Active Decisions
- **Backend Stability Priority**: Core conversion functionality must never be compromised by optimizations
- **Minimal Mobile Changes**: Mobile compatibility through frontend enhancements and safe logging only
- **Cross-Platform Processing**: Equal conversion capabilities for desktop and mobile users
- **Conservative Backend Approach**: Avoid complex timeout logic or validation that could interfere with processing
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Local Docker deployment is the primary and recommended deployment method
- **Image Preprocessing**: All images are preprocessed with ImageMagick trim and repage for optimal vectorization
- **VTracer-only for color**: Color vectorization uses VTracer exclusively for superior quality and color accuracy
- **Potrace for Black & White**: Black & White preset uses Potrace with ImageMagick preprocessing
- **Dimension Accuracy**: SVG output dimensions must exactly match original image dimensions
- **Selective Post-Processing**: Remove only black border artifacts while preserving legitimate content
- **Docker containerization**: Multi-stage builds with health checks for production deployment
- **Native binaries preferred**: Avoid WebAssembly alternatives for superior performance and quality
- **Step-by-step UI**: Clear, compact card layout with Radix UI components
- **Pan/zoom functionality**: Consistent across both raster and SVG previews with reset controls
- **Debug logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and quality assurance

## Lessons Learned
- **Backend Changes Risk**: Mobile compatibility attempts with strict file validation, corruption detection, and complex timeout logic broke core conversion functionality
- **Testing Critical**: All backend changes affecting core processing must be thoroughly tested before deployment
- **Conservative Approach**: Frontend-only mobile improvements are safer than backend modifications
- **Minimal Logging**: Mobile debugging should use only safe logging without affecting processing logic
- **User Feedback Important**: Immediate user feedback about broken functionality prevented extended downtime
