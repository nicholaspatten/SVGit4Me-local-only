- Keeping frontend and backend settings/presets in sync
- Providing clear download/copy guidance for SVG output

## Recent Changes
- **Mobile Backend Compatibility**: Complete mobile device support with enhanced file validation, timeouts, and error handling
- **Cross-Browser SVG Testing**: Implemented comprehensive cross-browser compatibility test page with touch interactions
- **Mobile-Specific Timeouts**: Extended processing timeouts for mobile devices (90s vs 60s desktop)
- **Enhanced File Validation**: Strict file type checking, size limits, and corruption detection for mobile uploads
- **Docker Binary Verification**: Added startup checks for tool availability and permissions in containers
- **Mobile Error Messages**: Targeted error feedback with actionable suggestions for mobile users
- **SVG Black Lines Fixed**: Implemented comprehensive image preprocessing and SVG post-processing to eliminate black border artifacts
- **Dimension Accuracy**: SVG output now matches original image dimensions exactly through ImageMagick preprocessing
- **Image Preprocessing**: Added trim and repage operations to remove padding before vectorization
- **VTracer Optimization**: Streamlined VTracer command execution with proper error handling and logging
- **Post-Processing Pipeline**: Selective removal of background/border elements while preserving content integrity
- **Zoom Controls Restored**: Full pan/zoom functionality maintained with proper scale and offset management
- **Debug Logging Enhanced**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting SVG generation issues
- **Docker containerization completed**: Production-ready Docker setup with multi-stage build and health checks
- **Deployment strategy finalized**: Local Docker deployment for privacy-first architecture
- **VTracer binary installation**: Resolved ARM64 compatibility and permission issues in Docker containers
- UI reorganized into clear, compact step-by-step cards with tooltips and accessibility improvements
- Preset system with custom Radix UI components for professional styling
- Pan/zoom functionality for both raster and SVG previews with reset controls

## Next Steps
- Further UI/UX refinements for compactness and clarity.
- Add more robust error messages and edge case handling.
- Consider extensibility for new presets or backend engines.
- Update documentation and Memory Bank as changes are made.
- **Deploy Docker container to Railway/Render** (recommended platforms for quality).
- **Set up CI/CD pipeline** for automated Docker builds and deployments.
- **Configure environment variables** for production deployment.
- **Test vectorization quality** on deployed platform to ensure consistency.
- **Verify color vectorization** works correctly on deployed platform with VTracer-only approach.

## Active Decisions
- **Mobile-First Backend**: Full mobile device compatibility with extended timeouts and enhanced error handling
- **Cross-Platform Processing**: Equal conversion capabilities for desktop and mobile users
- **Mobile File Limits**: 15MB size limit with strict validation for mobile browser compatibility
- **Device-Specific Timeouts**: 90 seconds for mobile devices, 60 seconds for desktop processing
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Local Docker deployment is the primary and recommended deployment method
- **Image Preprocessing**: All images are preprocessed with ImageMagick trim and repage for optimal vectorization
- **VTracer-only for color**: Color vectorization uses VTracer exclusively for superior quality and color accuracy
- **Potrace for Black & White**: Black & White preset uses Potrace with ImageMagick preprocessing
- **Dimension Accuracy**: SVG output dimensions must exactly match original image dimensions
- **Selective Post-Processing**: Remove only black border artifacts while preserving legitimate content
- **Docker containerization**: Multi-stage builds with health checks for production deployment
- **Native binaries preferred**: Avoid WebAssembly alternatives for superior performance and quality
- **Step-by-step UI**: Clear, compact card layout with Radix UI components
- **Pan/zoom functionality**: Consistent across both raster and SVG previews with reset controls
- **Debug logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and quality assurance
