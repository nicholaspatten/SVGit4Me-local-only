üîí **Privacy Matters: Introducing SVGit4Me - Local-Only SVG Conversion**

Tired of uploading your valuable images to unknown servers for vectorization? I built SVGit4Me to solve exactly this problem.

**üè† What makes it different?**
‚úÖ 100% local processing - your images NEVER leave your computer
‚úÖ Runs in Docker containers on your machine
‚úÖ Works completely offline after setup
‚úÖ Zero data collection or tracking
‚úÖ Professional-grade results using VTracer & Potrace

**‚ö° Why local processing matters:**
‚Ä¢ Your intellectual property stays private
‚Ä¢ No upload limits or file size restrictions  
‚Ä¢ No subscription fees or usage tracking
‚Ä¢ Works with sensitive/confidential images
‚Ä¢ Lightning fast - no network bottlenecks

**üéØ Perfect for:**
‚Ä¢ Designers working with client assets
‚Ä¢ Companies with strict data policies
‚Ä¢ Anyone who values privacy
‚Ä¢ Converting logos, illustrations, photos to scalable SVGs

**‚è±Ô∏è Yes, it might take a few extra seconds compared to cloud services - but that's because your browser is doing the heavy lifting locally instead of sending your files to external servers.**

The trade-off? Complete privacy and security of your creative work.

**üöÄ Ready to try?**
Clone the repo, run one Docker command, and start converting images to high-quality SVGs without ever uploading a single file.

Live Demo: Run locally with Docker

What do you think? Would you trade a few extra seconds of processing time for complete privacy and control over your images?
